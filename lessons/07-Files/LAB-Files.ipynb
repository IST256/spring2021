    "\n",
    "## Parsing Email Headers\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab, we will write a program to read data from a mailbox file like `mbox-tiny.txt` or `mbox-short.txt`. These files contain raw email data, and in that data are attributes like who the message is To, From, the subject and SPAM confidence number for each message, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475`\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal will be to find each of these lines in the file, and extract the confidence number (In this case `0.8475`), with the end-goal of calculating the average SPAM Confidence of all the emails in the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the files we need\n",
    "\n",
    "Run this code to fetch the files we need for this lab. This linux code downloads them from the internet and saves them to your folder on jupyterhub.\n"
