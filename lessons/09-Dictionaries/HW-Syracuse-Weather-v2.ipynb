    "The file with the weather data is: `\"NYC5-syr-weather-dec-2015.json\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should load this data into a Python list of dictionary using the `json` package. \n",
    "\n",
    "After you load this data, loop over the list of weather items and record each of the different weather events (found under the `\"Events\"`) key into another Python dictionary, talling the different types of weather events across the 31 days of December.\n",
    "\n",
    "When done correctly your output should be: \n",

    "\n",
    "This is a conceptually difficult problem and the solution is classic Python: 10 lines of code and quite cryptic looking. The best approach is to use **problem  simplifcation** to once again arrive at the answer. This program is too complicated to write all at once! Let's break it up into parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parts: \n",
    "1. Write a program to read `\"NYC5-syr-weather-dec-2015.json\"` into a python list of dict variable named `weather`\n",
    "2. With the `weather` variable print all the `\"Events\" keys. There should be 31 weather events one for each day in December\n",
    "3. Now that you know how to write the loop, modify the loop to add keys to another dictionary `events` where the value is the number of occurences of the event\n",
    "4. write the `events` Python dictionary as JSON to a file called `dec-2015-events.json`.\n",
    "5. Assemble parts 1 through 4 into a single program.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: In the problem analysis sections, the inputs and outputs are provided, but you must write the algorithms.\n"

This should be a personal narrative, in your own voice, and cite specifics relevant to the activity as to help the grader understand how you arrived at the code you submitted. Things to consider touching upon: Elaborate on the process itself. Did your original problem analysis work as designed?  How many iterations did you go through before you arrived at the solution? Where did you struggle along the way and how did you overcome it? What did you learn from completing the assignment? What do you need to work on to get better? What was most valuable and least valuable about this exercise? Do you have any suggestions for improvements?\n",
