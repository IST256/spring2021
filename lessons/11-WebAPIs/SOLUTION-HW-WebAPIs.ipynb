    "# Homework: TLDL: The Gist of a Song\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "TLDL: Too Long didn't listen. In this assignment you are tasked with producing the gist of any song through its lyrics. The parts you need for this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. An API to find the song given a title and artist\n",
    "    2. An API to retrieve the lyrics for the song\n",
    "    3. Run key phrase extraction over the lyrics to discover what the song is about\n",
    "    4. Run sentiment analysis over the lyrics to identify the mood\n",
    "\n",
    "A bottom-up approach is suggested. Solve problems 1-4 first and then assemble into a working program that when given a title and author will provide a song LTDL gist. `{title} by {artist} is a {sentiment} song about {key phrases}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Song: First world problems\n",
    "    Artist: Weird Al Yankovic\n",
    "    \n",
    "    TLDL (Output): \n",
    "    First World Problems by Weird Al Yankovic is a mixed song about ['world problems', 'wallet small', 'corner', 'vending machine', 'water', 'hour', 'laptop screen', 'bills', 'maid', 'bathroom', 'breakfast menu', 'bread', 'tiramisu', 'pixel', 'shower', 'idiot', 'phone']\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "For style points use `@interact_manual`, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "HINTS and ADVICE:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can use the Musixmatch API https://developer.musixmatch.com/ to search for songs and retrieve the lyrics. \n",
    "    - The free version of the API provides access to 30% of the lyrics. This should be sufficient. \n",
    "    - Similar to Zomato, this API has a playground mode where you can try it out in the browser. https://playground.musixmatch.com/\n",
    "- Take a bottom up approach! Implement each step as a function, solving that problem then putting the entire program together from the pieces\n",
    "- Leverage what you learned from the lab to perform sentiment and key-phrase analysis. That code should be easy to incorporate.\n",
    "- Don't worry about coding around errors, but do think about how you might handle them (there's a question about it).\n",
